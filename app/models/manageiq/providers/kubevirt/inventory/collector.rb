# This class contains the data needed to perform a refresh. The data are the collections of nodes, virtual machines and
# templates retrieved using the KubeVirt API.
#
# Note that unlike other typical collectors it doesn't really retrieve that data itself: the refresh worker will create
# with the data that it already obtained from the KubeVirt API.
